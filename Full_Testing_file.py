
#Image Processing
#read in the image as numpy array/matrix (must be grayscaled)
#take and save 32x32 offset samples of an image (1-5 pixels offset?)
#break 32x32 samples in to smaller 8x8 samples for k-means prep
#pass image dimensions through

#K-Tester file
#feed the array of samples into k-mean testing aglo to get equivalent centroid locations

#MLP-tester file
#Put the 8x8 samples back together and flatten to reform 32x32 centroid representations of the samples
#Feed through Testing MLP
#visualized representation of where letters are thought to be on the image
